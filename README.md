# VBA-challenge
This is a script I created called StockCrawler (Homework 02 VBA)

It searches through years of daily stock data, and outputs a new table summarizing:
- The ticker symbol
- The Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- and, The total stock volume of the stock.

The STockCrawler script also uses conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in stock prices in green and negative changes in red.

Finally, it also calculates the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" on every worksheet, only running the VBA script once.
